1. check all features by comparing with other frameworks for audio feature extraction
2. add temporal features
3. analyze presets and write model.fcl
4. change distance function so that all features are normalized
5. try different tremination criteria for genetic algorithm
6. consider using standard devation of features relatively to the mean, since the features are not linear to the human perception!
	- use sigmas instead of std_dev?
