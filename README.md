This project is a proof of concept for a generic algorithm for automatic selection of sound synthesis parameters based on input verbal descriptions. The user can specify desired sound characteristics using adjectives and the system will choose parameters which produce a corresponding sound. The unique feature of the algorithm is that it does not rely on prior knowledge of the underlying sound synthesizer so it can be applied to any sound synthesis technique. The first step of the algorithm is the quantification of input adjectives achieved by an expert system based on fuzzy logic. The second step is the selection of synthesis parameter using a genetic algorithm with the intent of reaching the quantified goal generated by the first step.
